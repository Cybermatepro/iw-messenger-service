          <p>
            This is to remind you that your campaign (<strong
              ><span th:text="${campaignName}"></span></strong
            >) will reach its set target date in a week. Once your campaign has reached its target
            date, it will no longer be available for donations.
          </p>

          <p>
            We can see that you have not yet met your planned target amount. If you wish, you could
            extend your target date.
          </p>

          <div class="pi-email-flex-container">
            <button class="pi-email-button secondary">Edit Campaign</button>
          </div>

          <p>Otherwise we hope you were able to get closer to achieving your dreams.</p>

          <p>We are always here the next time you intend to raise money for a cause.</p>
